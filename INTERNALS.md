# `ltsis` — Internals

Specification, design, implementation, and verification notes for the
`ltsis` crate. The user-facing `README.md` covers what the crate does and
how to call it; this document covers *how* and *why* it's built the way
it is. Read this if you're modifying the implementation, auditing the
math, porting to a different float type or platform, or considering
similar primitives in other crates.

---

## 1. Abstract

`ltsis` exposes O(n) primitives for **multinomial sampling** —
i.e. drawing n iid samples with replacement from a discrete weight
distribution. The construction combines the classical Bentley–Saxe
spacings recurrence for sorted uniforms with the merge-against-cumulative-
weights step of Massey (ICASSP 2008). Compared to that paper, the
present work supplies a corrected variate sampler (the original used a
buggy Ziggurat) and a careful floating-point boundary argument that
makes the merge memory-safe even at f32 precision. The crate is `f32`
throughout, allocation-free, and `no_std`-compatible.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Problem statement

Given a vector of $m$ non-negative weights $w_1, \ldots, w_m$ with
$T = \sum_j w_j > 0$, and an output count $n$, produce a sequence
$J_1 \le J_2 \le \cdots \le J_n$ of indices into `weights` such that
the joint distribution of $(J_1, \ldots, J_n)$ is identical to that
of $(K_{(1)}, \ldots, K_{(n)})$, where $K_1, \ldots, K_n$ are iid
with $\Pr[K_a = j] = w_j / T$ and $K_{(\cdot)}$ denotes their order
statistics.

In other words: equivalent to taking $n$ iid multinomial draws on
the weight distribution and sorting them, but produced in a single
$O(m + n)$ pass.

### 2.2. Public API

Two functions, deliberately not symmetric:

```rust
fn sample_indices<'a, R>(rng: &'a mut R, weights: &'a [f32], n: u32)
    -> SampleIndices<'a, R>;                   // yields n × u32

fn sample_indices_buffered(rng: &mut impl Rng,
                           weights: &[f32],
                           out: &mut [u32]);
```

`sample_indices` returns an iterator that yields `n` `u32` indices
in ascending order. The buffered variant takes an `&mut [u32]`
instead — it uses each output slot as f32 scratch (via
`f32::to_bits`/`from_bits`, see §4.5), so it cannot be lazy.

Indices are `u32` rather than `usize` so the on-disk layout is
identical on every platform (16-, 32-, or 64-bit `usize`).

Plus two lower-level primitives:

- `first_uniform(rng, k) -> f32` — samples
  $\min(U_1, \ldots, U_k)$ for $k$ iid $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$.
  Equivalently, samples $\mathrm{Beta}(1, k)$.
- `SortedUniforms::new(rng, n)` — an iterator yielding $n$
  $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ variates in ascending order.

### 2.3. Preconditions

- `weights.is_empty() == false`.
- `weights.len() <= u32::MAX`.
- All weights are finite and non-negative (debug-asserted).
- `Σ weights > 0`.

Note that the "memory-safe" guarantee rests on Lemma 3
(§5.2).

---

## 3. Design

### 3.1. The order-statistic recurrence

The sorted uniforms $U_{(1)} < U_{(2)} < \cdots < U_{(n)}$ of $n$
iid $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ draws can be generated sequentially in
$O(n)$ via the spacings recurrence (Bentley & Saxe 1980;
Devroye 1986, §V.3.1). At step $i$ with $\mathrm{last} = U_{(i-1)}$:

$$
\mathrm{spacing} \sim \mathrm{Beta}(1, k), \qquad k = n - i + 1
$$
$$
\mathrm{yield} = \mathrm{last} + (1 - \mathrm{last}) \cdot \mathrm{spacing}
$$

The conditional distribution of $U_{(i)}$ given
$U_{(i-1)} = u$ is the minimum of $n - i + 1$ iid
$\mathrm{Uniform}(u, 1)$ draws (Lemma 1, §5.1), and that minimum
equals $u + (1 - u) \cdot Z$ where $Z$ is the minimum of
$n - i + 1$ iid $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ draws — i.e.
$Z \sim \mathrm{Beta}(1, k)$. [`SortedUniforms`] implements this
recurrence; [`first_uniform`] samples $Z$.

### 3.2. The merge

Given sorted uniforms and a cumulative weight array
$W_j = w_1 + \cdots + w_j$ (so $W_m = T$), the inverse-CDF
construction of multinomial sampling (Theorem 2, §5.1) gives

$$
J_i = \min \{\, j : T \cdot U_{(i)} < W_j \,\}.
$$

Because $j \mapsto W_j$ is monotone, the map $U \mapsto J$ is
monotone non-decreasing; sorting the inputs gives sorted outputs.
Implementation: walk the sorted uniforms left-to-right with a single
advancing cursor $j$, maintaining $\mathrm{cumulative} = W_j$ as a
running prefix sum. For each yielded $U_{(i)}$, advance $j$ while
$\mathrm{total} \cdot U_{(i)} > \mathrm{cumulative}$, then record
$J_i = j$. Total work $O(m + n)$ since each cursor advances
monotonically.

### 3.3. f32 throughout

All public APIs are `f32`. The realistic deployment target is
Cortex-M4F (and similar single-precision FPUs), where every f64
operation is a software call. Going all-f32 keeps the hot path on
the FPU; numerical robustness comes from Kahan summation (§4.4),
not from extra precision.

### 3.4. Two variants

- **`sample_indices`** (streaming): generates each sorted uniform
  via [`SortedUniforms`] / [`first_uniform`] — one `powf` per output
  index. Returns an iterator; no additional memory.
- **`sample_indices_buffered`** (buffered): uses a different
  sorted-uniforms generator — the Gamma-ratio identity
  $U_{(i)} = (E_1 + \cdots + E_i) / (E_1 + \cdots + E_{n+1})$
  where $E_j \sim \mathrm{Exp}(1)$ iid. Trades one
  $\mathrm{Exp}(1)$ draw per output for the `powf`. On x86 with a
  tuned libm this is ~1.3× faster per element; on Cortex-M4F where
  scalar `powf` is much slower than an Exp Ziggurat, the gap widens.

The buffered variant repurposes the caller's `out` slice as f32
scratch via [`f32::to_bits`] (§4.5), so it cannot expose an
iterator; the streaming variant has no scratch to share and so is
free to.

---

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. `first_uniform` — inverse CDF in f32

The minimum of $k$ iid $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ draws has CDF
$F(x) = 1 - (1 - x)^k$ and inverse
$F^{-1}(u) = 1 - (1 - u)^{1/k}$. Implementation:

```rust
let u: f32 = rng.gen();   // u ∈ [0, 1 − 2⁻²⁴]
1.0 - (1.0 - u).powf(1.0 / k as f32)
```

This form is preferred over the algebraically equivalent
$1 - u^{1/k}$ (from substituting $v = 1 - u$, also uniform)
because it has better f32 boundary behavior. With $1 - u^{1/k}$,
the input $u = 0$ (which `rng.gen()` produces with probability
$2^{-24}$) yields $0^{1/k} = 0$, and the function returns 1 —
outside the $[0, 1)$ support, which would freeze the order-
statistic recurrence at $\mathrm{last} = 1$. Earlier versions
guarded this with a redraw.

The chosen form $1 - (1 - u)^{1/k}$ is well-behaved with no
special case: $1 - u$ lands in $[2^{-24}, 1]$ exactly representably
in f32 (since $1 - i \cdot 2^{-24}$ is f32-representable for
$i = 0, \ldots, 2^{24}$), so
$(1 - u)^{1/k} \in [2^{-24/k}, 1]$ and the output is in
$[0, 1 - 2^{-24/k}] \subset [0, 1)$. Each of the $2^{24}$ input
bins maps to a distinct output, all in range.

There is one benign rounding artifact: for very large `k` and `u`
near 0, `(1 − u)^(1/k)` can round to exactly 1 in f32, making the
output 0 and `spacing = 0`; the recurrence then yields the prior
`last` again. This is an f32 quantization of "consecutive order
statistics rounded to the same value" and not a Lemma 3 violation.

### 4.2. `SortedUniforms` iterator

State: `(rng: &mut R, remaining: u32, last: f32)`. Each `next()`:

1. If `remaining == 0`, return `None`.
2. `let spacing = first_uniform(rng, remaining);`
3. `last += (1.0 - last) * spacing;`
4. `remaining -= 1;`
5. `Some(last)`.

Implements `Iterator`, `ExactSizeIterator` (`size_hint` returns
`(remaining, Some(remaining))` exactly), and `FusedIterator` (once
`remaining` hits 0, all further calls return `None`). `count()` is
overridden to return `remaining as usize` directly without
exhausting the RNG.

### 4.3. `sample_indices` (streaming)

```
1. Kahan-sum `total = Σ weights`.
2. For each of n output slots:
   a. Pull a sorted uniform `u` from SortedUniforms.
   b. Compute `target = total * u`.
   c. While `target > cumulative`:
        j += 1; Kahan-add weights[j] to cumulative.
   d. Write out[i] = j as u32.
```

`cumulative` starts at `weights[0]` (equivalent to one Kahan step
from `(0, 0)`). The `total` walk and the merge's `cumulative` walk
are both Kahan sums of `weights` in index order from `(sum, c) = (0, 0)`,
so they end bit-for-bit equal — a precondition of Lemma 3.

### 4.4. `sample_indices_buffered` (buffered)

```
1. Kahan-sum `total = Σ weights`.
2. Phase 1: for each of n output slots:
   a. Draw `e ~ Exp(1)` (Ziggurat).
   b. Stash `e.to_bits()` into out[i] (treating the u32 slot as f32 bits).
   c. Kahan-add e to running G.
3. Draw e_extra ~ Exp(1); Kahan-add to G (don't store).
4. Compute inv_g = 1/G.
5. Phase 2: walk out left-to-right:
   a. e = f32::from_bits(out[i]); recover the stashed Exp draw.
   b. Kahan-add e to cumulative_e (= S_i).
   c. u = cumulative_e * inv_g; target = (total * u).min(total).
   d. While target > cumulative_w:
        j += 1; Kahan-add weights[j] to cumulative_w.
   e. Write out[i] = j as u32.
```

Note that this routine does *not* call `first_uniform` or use
`SortedUniforms` — the Gamma-ratio identity gives sorted uniforms
directly without `powf`.

The `target.min(total)` clip is load-bearing for memory safety
because of the multiply-by-inverse design choice (step 4 / step 5c).
We compute `inv_g = 1.0 / G` once and then `u = cumulative_e *
inv_g` per output, rather than `u = cumulative_e / G`. This saves
one f32 division per element on the hot path, but introduces an
asymmetry: while `cumulative_e ≤ G` strictly in exact arithmetic
(both Kahan-summed in the same order, with `G` including the extra
`E_{n+1} > 0`), in f32 the rounded inverse `inv_g` can sit slightly
above `1/G`, and then `cumulative_e * inv_g` can round to a value
just above 1.0 — namely `1.0 + 2⁻²³`, the next f32 above 1.0.
Without the clip, `target = total * u` could then strictly exceed
`cumulative_w = total` at the right endpoint, and the merge would
advance `j` past `weights.len() - 1`.

With the clip, `target ≤ total`, and Lemma 3 (§5.2) — which gives
`cumulative_w == total` bit-for-bit at `j = m − 1` — keeps the
merge inside the slice exactly as it does for the streaming
variant.

(An alternative that avoids the clip entirely would be to compute
`u = cumulative_e / G` directly. The natural-bound argument from
streaming then transfers verbatim. We don't take that route because
the per-element division is measurably slower than multiply-by-
precomputed-inverse on every CPU we care about.)

### 4.5. In-place scratch via `f32::to_bits` round-trip

The buffered variant needs `n` Exp(1) draws temporarily before it
walks them again to compute indices. Rather than asking the caller
for a `&mut [f32]` scratch buffer, it stashes each draw's bit
pattern in the output slot it'll later overwrite with the index:

```rust
// Phase 1 store:
*slot = e.to_bits();          // u32, exact bit representation of e

// Phase 2 load:
let e = f32::from_bits(*slot);
// ... compute index j ...
*slot = j as u32;
```

`to_bits` / `from_bits` round-trips are exact for every f32 value
(including NaN and ±∞). Because `out` slots are exactly 32 bits
(`u32`, not `usize`), the layout is platform-independent.

### 4.6. Kahan compensated summation

Every multi-term accumulator on the data path uses Kahan summation:

```rust
fn kahan_add(sum: &mut f32, c: &mut f32, x: f32) {
    let y = x - *c;
    let t = *sum + y;
    *c = (t - *sum) - y;
    *sum = t;
}
```

Naive f32 prefix sums over n non-negative terms accrue relative
error of order `O(n · 2⁻²⁴)`, which becomes unusable around
n ≈ 10⁵. Kahan reduces the bound to `O(2⁻²⁴ · max|term|)` —
effectively constant in `n`.

Accumulators using Kahan:
- `total = Σ weights` and the merge's incremental `cumulative_w`
  in both `sample_indices` and `sample_indices_buffered`.
- `G = Σ Eᵢ` and the merge's `cumulative_e = Sᵢ` in
  `sample_indices_buffered`.

The bit-for-bit identity used in Lemma 3 depends on both the
up-front `total` walk and the merge's `cumulative_w` walk using the
same algorithm and traversal order. Both Kahan-sum `weights` in
increasing index order from `(sum, c) = (0, 0)`. Any change here —
parallel reduce, different traversal, switching to a non-Kahan
accumulator — would invalidate Lemma 3.

### 4.7. Precondition checks in release builds

All four preconditions (§2.3) are checked with `assert!` in
release, not `debug_assert!`:

1. `weights` nonempty — O(1).
2. `weights.len() ≤ u32::MAX` — O(1).
3. Each `weights[i]` finite and nonnegative — O(m), one extra
   branch per element inside the `total` Kahan loop.
4. `Σ weights > 0` — O(1) (a single comparison after the sum).

Items 1, 2, 4 are clearly free. The interesting one is item 3:
its cost is amortized into a loop that already does a Kahan add
(four f32 ops per element). Microbenchmark on the host (m = n =
10⁶, weights `1..=m`) shows the full pipeline shifting from
15.0 ns/step to 15.3 ns/step (streaming) and 11.2 → 11.4 ns/step
(buffered) — about 2% slowdown each, well under the 5% bar we
set when deciding whether to keep this check release-on. We
keep it on because the cost of *not* checking — silent garbage
output from a stray NaN, or an out-of-bounds index from a
negative weight that smuggles `cumulative_w` past `total` —
is much worse than a couple of cycles per element on the cold
prefix-sum loop.

The merge loop itself does no such checks: it operates on
`weights[j]` after we've already validated the slice once.

## 5. Validation & verification

(This is Claude output, currently unchecked by a human
statistician. Corrections welcome.)

### 5.1. Mathematical correctness

#### Lemma 1 (memorylessness of uniform order statistics)

Let $U_1, \ldots, U_n$ be iid $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ and let
$U_{(1)} \le \cdots \le U_{(n)}$ be their order statistics. For any
$1 \le i \le n - 1$, conditional on $U_{(i)} = u$, the remaining
order statistics $U_{(i+1)}, \ldots, U_{(n)}$ are jointly
distributed as the order statistics of $n - i$ iid
$\mathrm{Uniform}(u, 1)$ variates.

*Proof.* Standard property of order statistics from a continuous
distribution; see Devroye (1986), §V.3, or David & Nagaraja (2003),
§2.4. The key fact: conditional on $U_{(i)} = u$, the values $U_j$
exceeding $u$ are iid $\mathrm{Uniform}(u, 1)$. ∎

#### Lemma 2 (minimum of k uniforms)

If $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ are iid $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ then
$\min(V_1, \ldots, V_k)$ has CDF $F(v) = 1 - (1 - v)^k$ on
$[0, 1]$ — i.e. $\min(V_1, \ldots, V_k) \sim \mathrm{Beta}(1, k)$.

*Proof.*
$\Pr[\min_i V_i > v] = \prod_i \Pr[V_i > v] = (1 - v)^k$. ∎

#### Theorem 1 (correctness of `SortedUniforms`)

The iterator `SortedUniforms::new(rng, n)` yields a sequence of
values distributed as the order statistics of $n$ iid
$\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ variates.

*Proof.* By induction on $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. Write
$\mathrm{last}_i$ for the internal `last` after the $i$-th yield,
with $\mathrm{last}_0 = 0$.

*Base case* ($i = 1$). $\mathrm{remaining} = n$, $\mathrm{last} = 0$.
Compute $\mathrm{spacing} = \mathtt{first\_uniform}(rng, n)$,
distributed as $\mathrm{Beta}(1, n)$ by construction; by Lemma 2
this is the distribution of the minimum of $n$ iid
$\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ — i.e. of $U_{(1)}$. Yield is
$0 + 1 \cdot \mathrm{spacing} = \mathrm{spacing}$, so
$\mathrm{last}_1 \sim U_{(1)}$. ✓

*Inductive step.* Assume $(\mathrm{last}_1, \ldots, \mathrm{last}_i)$
has the joint distribution of $(U_{(1)}, \ldots, U_{(i)})$. Now
$\mathrm{remaining} = n - i$,
$\mathrm{spacing} = \mathtt{first\_uniform}(rng, n - i) \sim
\mathrm{Beta}(1, n - i)$. By Lemma 1, conditional on
$\mathrm{last}_i = u$, $U_{(i+1)}$ is the minimum of $n - i$ iid
$\mathrm{Uniform}(u, 1)$ draws, equal in distribution to
$u + (1 - u) \cdot \min(W_1, \ldots, W_{n-i})$ for $W_j$ iid
$\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$. By Lemma 2 the inner min is
$\mathrm{Beta}(1, n - i)$, exactly the distribution of
$\mathrm{spacing}$. So
$\mathrm{last}_{i+1} = \mathrm{last}_i + (1 - \mathrm{last}_i)
\cdot \mathrm{spacing}$ has the correct conditional distribution
given $\mathrm{last}_i$, extending the hypothesis to step $i + 1$. ∎

#### Theorem 2 (correctness of `sample_indices`)

Let $w_1, \ldots, w_m \ge 0$ with $T = \sum_j w_j > 0$. Define iid
multinomial draws $K_1, \ldots, K_n$ with $\Pr[K_a = j] = w_j / T$.
Then the output sequence $J_1 \le \cdots \le J_n$ produced by
`sample_indices(rng, weights, n)` has the same joint distribution
as the sorted multinomial sample $(K_{(1)}, \ldots, K_{(n)})$.
(1-indexed in this proof; the code is 0-indexed.)

*Proof.* Let $W_j = w_1 + \cdots + w_j$, $F(j) = W_j / T$. The
inverse-CDF multinomial sampler draws $U_a \sim
\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ and sets

$$
K_a = \min \{\, j : F(j) > U_a \,\} = \min \{\, j : T \cdot U_a < W_j \,\}. \quad (\ast)
$$

This is correct because $F(j - 1) \le U_a < F(j)$ happens with
probability $w_j / T$. The map $U_a \mapsto K_a$ is monotone non-
decreasing, so sorting the $U_a$ and applying $(\ast)$ yields the
sorted multinomial sample:

```
(K₍₁₎, ..., K₍ₙ₎) = (φ(U₍₁₎), ..., φ(U₍ₙ₎))                  (∗∗)
```

where $\varphi(u) = \min \{\, j : T \cdot u < W_j \,\}$. By
Theorem 1, `sample_indices` yields $(U_{(1)}, \ldots, U_{(n)})$
distributed as the order statistics of $n$ iid
$\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$. For each yielded $U_{(i)}$, the merge sets
$\mathrm{target} = T \cdot U_{(i)}$ and advances $j$ until
$\mathrm{target} \le \mathrm{cumulative} = W_j$, giving

$$
J_i = \min \{\, j : W_j \ge T \cdot U_{(i)} \,\}. \quad (\ast{\ast}\ast)
$$

Predicates $(\ast)$ and $(\ast{\ast}\ast)$ differ only on the event
$T \cdot U = W_j$, a measure-zero event under the continuous
uniform distribution. So $J_i = \varphi(U_{(i)})$ almost surely,
matching $(\ast\ast)$. ∎

### 5.2. Lemma 3 (floating-point boundary)

Suppose `weights[i]` are finite and non-negative with positive sum.
Then `sample_indices` cannot index past `weights.len() − 1`
regardless of values yielded by `SortedUniforms`, provided those
values lie in `[0, 1]`.

*Proof.* `total` is computed by Kahan compensated summation walking
`weights` in index order from `(sum, c) = (0, 0)`:

```
(total, total_c) = (0, 0)
for w in weights:
    (total, total_c) = kahan_add(total, total_c, w)
```

When `j` reaches `m − 1` in the merge, `(cumulative, cumulative_c)`
has been built by initializing `(weights[0], 0)` (equivalent to one
Kahan step from `(0, 0)`, since the first compensator update is
zero) then `kahan_add(cumulative, cumulative_c, weights[k])` for
`k = 1, ..., m − 1` — same weights, same order, same accumulator
algorithm. IEEE 754 addition is deterministic in operands and
rounding mode (round-to-nearest, default in Rust), so Kahan
summation is also deterministic. The two sequences yield bit-
identical results: `cumulative == total` exactly when `j = m − 1`.

Each value `u` yielded by `SortedUniforms` satisfies `u ≤ 1`. Since
`total` is f32-representable and `u ∈ [0, 1]`, the exact product
`total · u ≤ total`; in round-to-nearest f32 this rounds to a
representable value `≤ total` (because `total` itself is
representable, every value `< total` rounds to a representable
value `≤ total`). So `target ≤ total = cumulative` whenever
`j = m − 1`, and the strict inequality `target > cumulative` is
false: the while loop exits with `j = m − 1` rather than
incrementing further. ∎

The buffered variant additionally applies a `target.min(total)`
clip in its merge. This handles the rare f32 case where
`u_n = S_n / G` rounds up to exactly 1.0 (the underlying inputs
satisfy `S_n < G` strictly, but f32 rounding can lose the strict
inequality). Without the clip, `target` could nominally exceed
`total = cumulative_w` at the right endpoint; with it, the merge
terminates within `weights.len()` regardless.

### 5.3. f32 quantization edge case

`first_uniform` returns values strictly in `[0, 1)` by
construction (§4.1). Each of the 2²⁴ input bins from
`rng.gen::<f32>()` maps to a distinct output. For very large `k`
and `u` near 0, `(1 − u)^(1/k)` can round to exactly 1 in f32,
making the output 0 and `spacing = 0`. The recurrence then yields
the prior `last` again — a vanishing statistical artifact (the
f32 quantization of "consecutive order statistics rounded to the
same value"), not a Lemma 3 violation since `last ≤ 1` is
preserved.

### 5.4. Statistical test methodology

(Tests written by Claude under direction; the threshold algebra
below has not been independently audited. Corrections welcome.)

#### 5.4.1. Aggregate budget and per-test allocation

The integration tests in `tests/statistical.rs` (run via `cargo
test`) check ten properties of `first_uniform`, `SortedUniforms`,
and the two samplers. All RNG seeds are fixed (`SmallRng`,
seed-based) so each test is a deterministic function of the
`rand` / `rand_distr` algorithm version pinned by `Cargo.lock`.

We aim for an **aggregate random-failure probability under correct
code below $10^{-9}$**. With ten tests this leaves $\sim 10^{-10}$
per test (Bonferroni union bound over tests). Each test internally
runs $S$ sub-checks (one per parameter setting); we Bonferroni-
correct again to give each sub-check a budget of $10^{-10}/S
\approx 10^{-11}$. The thresholds defined as constants at the top
of the test file (`KS_CRITICAL = 3.7`, `NORMAL_Z_SINGLE = 7.0`,
`NORMAL_Z_MAX_OVER_POS = 7.5`, `CHISQ_Z = 7.0`) are calibrated to
that per-sub-check budget; the per-test entries below show the
arithmetic.

#### 5.4.2. Reference formulae and citations

- **Two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov tail** (one- and two-sample):
  $\Pr[D > c/\sqrt{n_{\mathrm{eff}}}] \approx 2 \exp(-2c^2)$
  asymptotically. For two-sample with sizes $n_a, n_b$,
  $n_{\mathrm{eff}} = n_a n_b / (n_a + n_b)$. Standard derivation
  due to Smirnov (1939); a modern treatment is in Marsaglia, Tsang
  & Wang, *J. Stat. Softw.* 8(18), 2003 (also notes that the
  asymptotic underestimates the tail at small $n$, which we
  compensate for by oversizing the sample counts).
- **Wilson–Hilferty cube-root normalization of $\chi^2$**: if
  $X \sim \chi^2_d$, then
  $\bigl(X/d\bigr)^{1/3} \approx \mathcal{N}\!\bigl(1 -
  \tfrac{2}{9d}, \tfrac{2}{9d}\bigr)$, so the upper-tail
  critical value at standard-normal quantile $z$ is
  $d \bigl(1 - \tfrac{2}{9d} + z\sqrt{\tfrac{2}{9d}}\bigr)^3$.

#### 5.4.3. The ten tests

For each test we list: function name, null hypothesis, statistic
computed, asymptotic distribution under the null, threshold and
budget arithmetic, and number of sub-checks $S$.

**1. Range check** — `range`. Deterministic; no randomness budget.
Asserts every `first_uniform` sample lies in $[0, 1)$ across
$k \in \{1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 100, 1000\}$, 100,000 samples each. A
violation indicates a real bug, not a tail event. ($S = 0$
randomness sub-checks.)

**2. Empirical moments of `first_uniform`** — `moments_first_uniform`.
Null: `first_uniform(k)` is distributed as $\mathrm{Beta}(1, k)$.
For $k \in \{1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 50, 200\}$ (so $S = 7$), draw
$n = 10^6$ samples and compare empirical mean and variance against
the closed-form moments. Mean check: $z = |\bar{x} - \mu| /
\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ where $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}/n}$;
threshold `NORMAL_Z_SINGLE = 7.0` gives a per-sub-check tail of
$\Pr[|Z| > 7] \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-12}$, so
$2 S \cdot 2.6 \times 10^{-12} \approx 4 \times 10^{-11}$ for the
14 mean+variance sub-checks together — within budget. Variance
check: relative tolerance 2%, which at $n = 10^6$ is $\approx 14\sigma$
(swamped by the mean check above; not budget-limiting).

**3. One-sample KS against analytic CDF** — `ks_against_theory`.
Null: `first_uniform(k)` has CDF $F_k(x) = 1 - (1 - x)^k$. For
$k \in \{1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 50, 200\}$ ($S = 7$), draw $n = 50{,}000$
samples and compute $D = \sup_x |F_n(x) - F_k(x)|$. Threshold:
$D < c / \sqrt{n}$ with `KS_CRITICAL = 3.7`. Per-sub-check tail
$\approx 2 e^{-2 \cdot 3.7^2} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-12}$;
total over $S$ sub-checks $\approx 1.8 \times 10^{-11}$ — within
budget.

**4. Two-sample KS vs. independent oracle** — `ks_against_min_oracle`.
Null: `first_uniform(k)` and the trivial `min(rng.gen::<f32>(),
...)` over $k$ draws come from the same distribution. Statistic
is the standard two-sample KS $D$; critical value $c \cdot
\sqrt{(n_a + n_b) / (n_a n_b)}$ with $c = 3.7$, $n_a = n_b =
20{,}000$, $S = 5$ values of $k$. Same per-sub-check tail as
test 3.

**5. Sorted-uniforms per-position moments** — `sorted_uniforms_moments`.
Null: position $i$ of `SortedUniforms::new(rng, n)` is distributed
as $U_{(i)}$ from $n$ iid uniforms. For $n \in \{5, 20, 100\}$
($S = 3$ outer, but $\sum n = 125$ inner per-position sub-checks,
each yielding mean+variance), draw 200,000 runs and compare
per-position empirical moments to the closed-form. Mean check
threshold `NORMAL_Z_MAX_OVER_POS = 7.5` gives
$\Pr[|Z| > 7.5] \approx 6.4 \times 10^{-14}$; multiplied by the
maximum 100 positions per outer setting yields
$\approx 6 \times 10^{-12}$ per outer — within budget. Variance
relative tolerance 5% (well into the no-fail regime at $n_{\mathrm{runs}}
= 2 \times 10^5$).

**6. Pooled sorted-uniforms KS** — `sorted_uniforms_pooled_ks`.
Null: pooling all positions of many `SortedUniforms` runs gives
samples from $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ marginally. For $n \in
\{10, 100, 1000\}$ ($S = 3$), pool 50,000 total samples each and
KS-test against uniform CDF; $c = 3.7$ as in test 3.

**7. Sampler marginal $\chi^2$** — `sample_marginals_streaming`,
`sample_marginals_buffered`. Null: index $i$ appears with
probability $w_i / T$ in each sampler's output. For four weight
cases (`uniform-10`, `decreasing-8`, `peaky-12`,
`zeroes-mixed-6`), draw 4,000 runs of 50 samples each, accumulate
counts, and compute Pearson $\chi^2$ against expected counts
$n_{\mathrm{tot}} \cdot w_i / T$, dropping zero-weight cells.
Critical value via `chisq_critical(dof, CHISQ_Z = 7.0)`
(Wilson–Hilferty); per-sub-check tail
$\approx 1.3 \times 10^{-12}$. $S = 4$ weight cases × 2 samplers
= 8 sub-checks per pair, so each test contributes
$\approx 5 \times 10^{-12}$ — within budget. Zero-weight cells
are checked separately as exact equality (deterministic).

**8. Sampler vs. naive multinomial $\chi^2$** —
`sample_vs_multinomial_streaming`,
`sample_vs_multinomial_buffered`. Null: the sampler under test
and the naive reference (helper `naive_multinomial`, an O(m + n
log m) inverse-CDF construction) have the same per-index
probabilities. Two-sample Pearson $\chi^2$ on the
2-row contingency table of counts; same threshold as test 7.
$S = 3$ weight cases (`uniform-10`, `skewed-8`, `peaky-15`).

The reference `naive_multinomial` is implemented entirely in
**f64** internally — it builds the cumulative-weight array as
`Vec<f64>` and uses `partition_point` on a uniform-on-$[0, t)$
draw. No Kahan summation, no f32 prefix-sum noise. Its only
"trust assumption" is that `cum.partition_point(|&c| c <= target)`
implements binary search correctly (a `std` invariant). This is
intentionally distinct from the sampler under test so a bug in
either is exposed.

#### 5.4.4. Reproducibility caveat

The $10^{-9}$ budget is **per fixed `rand` / `rand_distr` algorithm
version and per fixed code usage of those crates**. If `rand`
bumps the algorithm of any of its samplers, or if our own pattern
of `rng.random()` / `Exp1.sample(rng)` calls changes, the seeded
sequences shift and a previously-passing test could land near a
threshold by coincidence. `Cargo.lock` is committed precisely to
pin those versions against this risk in CI and development. After
any change to crate code that touches RNG consumption (e.g. step
5 of the recent REVIEW pass: switching the streaming sampler to
an iterator), re-run `cargo test --release` and confirm no test
crosses its threshold; if one does, treat it as a real regression
rather than retuning the threshold.

### 5.5. Microbenchmark methodology

Two benches with deliberately different fencing strategies.

**`first_uniform` per-call (`bench_first_uniform`).** Each call is
wrapped in `std::hint::black_box`, so LLVM cannot fuse consecutive
iterations into a vectorized `powf` over a batch. This is what we
want: `first_uniform` is invoked one-at-a-time inside the streaming
sampler's spacings recurrence (each call's output feeds the next
call's `last`), so the realistic deployment cost is *scalar*
per-call. Cortex-M4F (and any other no-SIMD target) cannot
vectorize anyway, so the scalar number is also the relevant one
for the no_std target.

This is purely about *cross-call* vectorization. The libm internal
to a single `powf` call may itself use SIMD instructions to compute
that one result faster — `black_box` does not (and cannot) defeat
that, and we want the realistic per-call cost the libm delivers.
The ~10 ns/call we measure on host x86 is exactly that.

**Full sampling pipeline (`bench_sample`).** Fences are placed only
at the *outer* API boundary (`black_box(&mut rng)`,
`black_box(&weights)`, `black_box(&mut out)`); LLVM is free to
optimize *inside* the sampler call. This is intentional. The
buffered variant in particular has two flat passes over `out`
(phase 1 Exp1 fill; phase 2 merge), and on hosts with SIMD we
*want* those passes to autovectorize — that is exactly the
deployment configuration we are measuring. The streaming variant
cannot vectorize internally because of the spacings recurrence's
data dependency, so it gets no benefit either way; the numbers
reported in §6.2 reflect this asymmetry.

(In short: per-call bench fences cross-iteration vectorization
because that vectorization isn't available at deployment; the
pipeline bench does not fence internal vectorization because
that vectorization *is* available at deployment.)

## 6. Performance

### 6.1. `first_uniform` per-call cost (host x86, `black_box`-fenced)

| k | ns/sample |
|----|----|
| 2  | 9.9 |
| 5  | 10.1 |
| 10 | 10.0 |
| 50 | 10.1 |
| 200 | 9.9 |
| 1000 | 10.0 |

Essentially flat in `k`. Dominated by the scalar `f32::powf` call;
the RNG (Xoshiro256++ in `SmallRng`) is sub-nanosecond per draw and
contributes ~1 ns at most.

### 6.2. Full sampling pipeline

`m = n`, weights `1..=m`, `f32`, all calls `black_box`-fenced,
SmallRng (Xoshiro256++) seed-based. Run-to-run variance is ~3% on
each cell.

```
    m = n     streaming                buffered              streaming
              ns/call    ns/step       ns/call    ns/step    /buffered
      100         2870     14.35          2161     10.81        1.33x
     1000        29184     14.59         21862     10.93        1.33x
    10000       284775     14.24        222624     11.13        1.28x
   100000      2892905     14.46       2193198     10.97        1.32x
  1000000     28895398     14.45      21832852     10.92        1.32x
```

Linear scaling clean across five orders of magnitude. Per-step
cost dominated by the `Beta(1, k)` draw (streaming) or the
`Exp(1)` draw plus merge (buffered); cache effects don't
materially degrade large-`m` performance because the weight array
is touched in a single forward sweep.

### 6.3. Cortex-M4F expectations

On Cortex-M4F (no SIMD, scalar `powf` ~100–150 cycles, `Exp(1)`
Ziggurat ~30–60 cycles), the buffered variant is expected to win
by a larger margin than the ~1.32× we see on x86. We have no on-
target measurements yet.

## 7. Future directions

### 7.0. Note on splitting streaming/buffered into separate Cargo features

A natural-looking refactor would expose the streaming and buffered
samplers under separate Cargo features, on the theory that a
buffered-only `no_std` build could then drop `num-traits` (and
hence `libm`). It does not work: `rand_distr` 0.6 declares its
`num-traits` dependency with `default-features = false, features =
["libm"]` *unconditionally*, so as long as we use `Exp1` (or any
other `rand_distr` sampler) we transitively depend on `num-traits`
with the `libm` feature on. `cargo tree --no-default-features
--features libm` confirms this — `libm` v0.2 appears under
`num-traits` regardless of which `ltsis` feature we pick.

Conclusion: the refactor would change the public API surface
without removing any actual dependency. Not worth doing unless
either we drop `Exp1` (replace with our own Ziggurat) or
`rand_distr` changes its dependency-feature wiring.

### 7.1. Padé[m/m] rational squeeze for `first_uniform`

The library currently spends one `powf` per `first_uniform` call.
On Cortex-M4F that's expensive. An earlier exploration around a
polynomial squeeze was buggy (it ignored the Mₖ normalization in a
rejection-sampler formulation that was being tried at the time and
produced biased samples — empirical mean for k=2 came out 0.675 vs
theoretical 0.667). The original ICASSP 2008 paper's Ziggurat had a
similar normalization issue (envelope geometry mismatched across
n). Neither is retained.

A more promising not-yet-implemented direction is a Padé[m/m]
rational squeeze in a rejection scheme. The Padé[1/1] form of
`(1 − u)^(1/k)` reduces strikingly cleanly:

```
(1 − u)^(1/k)  ≈  (2k − (k+1)u) / (2k − (k−1)u)
```

so the spacing approximates `u / (k − (k−1)u/2)` (one mult, one
subtract, one divide; no transcendentals). Used directly as a
sampler this is biased — error grows large near `u → 1`, the rare-
but-real "large spacing" tail — and the bias compounds in
`SortedUniforms` over `n = 10⁶` samples. Used as a one-sided
*squeeze* in a rejection scheme with `powf` on the slow path, the
cost amortizes: most attempts decide via the cheap rational test,
and the rare `powf` evaluation is statistically negligible at
moderate-to-large `k`.

On host x86, this is unlikely to beat scalar `powf` (a tuned
libm at ~9 ns/call is hard to beat). On Cortex-M4F, where scalar
`powf` is ~100–150 cycles, an all-mults-and-adds fast path could
plausibly win 30–50%. Whether that's worth the complexity
(correctness proof for one-sidedness, careful slow-path semantics)
depends on the deployment target.
