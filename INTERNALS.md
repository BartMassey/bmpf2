# `ltsis` — Internals

Specification, design, implementation, and verification notes for the
`ltsis` crate. The user-facing `README.md` covers what the crate does and
how to call it; this document covers *how* and *why* it's built the way
it is. Read this if you're modifying the implementation, auditing the
math, porting to a different float type or platform, or considering
similar primitives in other crates.

---

## 1. Abstract

`ltsis` exposes O(n) primitives for **multinomial sampling** —
i.e. drawing n iid samples with replacement from a discrete weight
distribution. The construction combines the classical Bentley–Saxe
spacings recurrence for sorted uniforms with the merge-against-cumulative-
weights step of Massey (ICASSP 2008). Compared to that paper, the
present work supplies a corrected variate sampler (the original used a
buggy Ziggurat) and a careful floating-point boundary argument that
makes the merge memory-safe even at f32 precision. The crate is `f32`
throughout, allocation-free, and `no_std`-compatible.

---

## 2. Specification

### 2.1. Problem statement

Given a vector of `m` non-negative weights `w₁, ..., wₘ` with
`T = Σⱼ wⱼ > 0`, and an output count `n`, produce a sequence
`J₁ ≤ J₂ ≤ ... ≤ Jₙ` of indices into `weights` such that the joint
distribution of `(J₁, ..., Jₙ)` is identical to that of
`(K₍₁₎, ..., K₍ₙ₎)`, where `K₁, ..., Kₙ` are iid with
`Pr[Kₐ = j] = wⱼ / T` and `K₍·₎` denotes their order statistics.

In other words: equivalent to taking n iid multinomial draws on the
weight distribution and sorting them, but produced in a single O(m + n)
pass.

### 2.2. Public API

Two functions with identical signatures:

```rust
fn sample_indices         (rng: &mut impl Rng, weights: &[f32], out: &mut [u32]);
fn sample_indices_buffered(rng: &mut impl Rng, weights: &[f32], out: &mut [u32]);
```

Both write `out.len()` indices into `out`. Indices are `u32` rather
than `usize` so the on-disk layout is identical on every platform
(16-, 32-, or 64-bit `usize`).

Plus two lower-level primitives:

- `first_uniform(rng, k) -> f32` — samples `min(U₁, ..., Uₖ)` for
  k iid Uniform(0, 1). Equivalently, samples `Beta(1, k)`.
- `SortedUniforms::new(rng, n)` — an iterator yielding `n` Uniform(0, 1)
  variates in ascending order.

### 2.3. Preconditions

- `weights.is_empty() == false`.
- `weights.len() <= u32::MAX`.
- All weights are finite and non-negative (debug-asserted).
- `Σ weights > 0`.

Note that the "memory-safe" guarantee rests on Lemma 3
(§5.2).

---

## 3. Design

### 3.1. The order-statistic recurrence

The sorted uniforms `U₍₁₎ < U₍₂₎ < ... < U₍ₙ₎` of `n` iid
Uniform(0, 1) draws can be generated sequentially in O(n) via the
spacings recurrence (Bentley & Saxe 1980; Devroye 1986, §V.3.1). At
step `i` with `last = U₍ᵢ₋₁₎`:

```
spacing  ~  Beta(1, k)         where k = n − i + 1
yield    =  last + (1 − last) · spacing
```

The conditional distribution of `U₍ᵢ₎` given `U₍ᵢ₋₁₎ = u` is the
minimum of `n − i + 1` iid Uniform(u, 1) draws (Lemma 1, §5.1), and
that minimum equals `u + (1 − u) · Z` where `Z` is the minimum of
`n − i + 1` iid Uniform(0, 1) draws — i.e. `Z ~ Beta(1, k)`.
[`SortedUniforms`] implements this recurrence; [`first_uniform`]
samples `Z`.

### 3.2. The merge

Given sorted uniforms and a cumulative weight array
`Wⱼ = w₁ + ... + wⱼ` (so `Wₘ = T`), the inverse-CDF construction of
multinomial sampling (Theorem 2, §5.1) gives

```
Jᵢ  =  min { j : T · U₍ᵢ₎ < Wⱼ }.
```

Because `j ↦ Wⱼ` is monotone, the map `U ↦ J` is monotone non-
decreasing; sorting the inputs gives sorted outputs. Implementation:
walk the sorted uniforms left-to-right with a single advancing
cursor `j`, maintaining `cumulative = Wⱼ` as a running prefix sum.
For each yielded `U₍ᵢ₎`, advance `j` while `total · U₍ᵢ₎ > cumulative`,
then record `Jᵢ = j`. Total work O(m + n) since each cursor advances
monotonically.

### 3.3. f32 throughout

All public APIs are `f32`. The realistic deployment target is
Cortex-M4F (and similar single-precision FPUs), where every f64
operation is a software call. Going all-f32 keeps the hot path on
the FPU; numerical robustness comes from Kahan summation (§4.4),
not from extra precision.

### 3.4. Two variants

- **`sample_indices`** (streaming): generates each sorted uniform
  via [`SortedUniforms`] / [`first_uniform`] — one `powf` per output
  index. No additional memory beyond `out`.
- **`sample_indices_buffered`** (buffered): uses a different
  sorted-uniforms generator — the Gamma-ratio identity
  `U₍ᵢ₎ = (E₁ + ... + Eᵢ) / (E₁ + ... + Eₙ₊₁)` where `Eⱼ ~ Exp(1)`
  iid. Trades one Exp(1) draw per output for the `powf`. On x86 with
  a tuned libm this is ~1.3× faster per element; on Cortex-M4F where
  scalar `powf` is much slower than an Exp Ziggurat, the gap widens.

Identical signatures (no caller-supplied scratch); the buffered
variant repurposes `out` as scratch via [`f32::to_bits`] (§4.5).

---

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. `first_uniform` — inverse CDF in f32

The minimum of `k` iid Uniform(0, 1) draws has CDF
`F(x) = 1 − (1 − x)^k` and inverse `F⁻¹(u) = 1 − (1 − u)^(1/k)`.
Implementation:

```rust
let u: f32 = rng.gen();   // u ∈ [0, 1 − 2⁻²⁴]
1.0 - (1.0 - u).powf(1.0 / k as f32)
```

This form is preferred over the algebraically equivalent
`1 − u^(1/k)` (from substituting `v = 1 − u`, also uniform) because
it has better f32 boundary behavior. With `1 − u^(1/k)`, the input
`u = 0` (which `rng.gen()` produces with probability 2⁻²⁴) yields
`0^(1/k) = 0`, and the function returns 1 — outside the
`[0, 1)` support, which would freeze the order-statistic recurrence
at `last = 1`. Earlier versions guarded this with a redraw.

The chosen form `1 − (1 − u)^(1/k)` is well-behaved with no special
case: `1 − u` lands in `[2⁻²⁴, 1]` exactly representably in f32
(since `1 − i · 2⁻²⁴` is f32-representable for `i = 0..2²⁴`), so
`(1 − u)^(1/k) ∈ [2⁻²⁴ᐟᵏ, 1]` and the output is in
`[0, 1 − 2⁻²⁴ᐟᵏ] ⊂ [0, 1)`. Each of the 2²⁴ input bins maps to a
distinct output, all in range.

There is one benign rounding artifact: for very large `k` and `u`
near 0, `(1 − u)^(1/k)` can round to exactly 1 in f32, making the
output 0 and `spacing = 0`; the recurrence then yields the prior
`last` again. This is an f32 quantization of "consecutive order
statistics rounded to the same value" and not a Lemma 3 violation.

### 4.2. `SortedUniforms` iterator

State: `(rng: &mut R, remaining: u32, last: f32)`. Each `next()`:

1. If `remaining == 0`, return `None`.
2. `let spacing = first_uniform(rng, remaining);`
3. `last += (1.0 - last) * spacing;`
4. `remaining -= 1;`
5. `Some(last)`.

Implements `Iterator`, `ExactSizeIterator` (`size_hint` returns
`(remaining, Some(remaining))` exactly), and `FusedIterator` (once
`remaining` hits 0, all further calls return `None`). `count()` is
overridden to return `remaining as usize` directly without
exhausting the RNG.

### 4.3. `sample_indices` (streaming)

```
1. Kahan-sum `total = Σ weights`.
2. For each of n output slots:
   a. Pull a sorted uniform `u` from SortedUniforms.
   b. Compute `target = total * u`.
   c. While `target > cumulative`:
        j += 1; Kahan-add weights[j] to cumulative.
   d. Write out[i] = j as u32.
```

`cumulative` starts at `weights[0]` (equivalent to one Kahan step
from `(0, 0)`). The `total` walk and the merge's `cumulative` walk
are both Kahan sums of `weights` in index order from `(sum, c) = (0, 0)`,
so they end bit-for-bit equal — a precondition of Lemma 3.

### 4.4. `sample_indices_buffered` (buffered)

```
1. Kahan-sum `total = Σ weights`.
2. Phase 1: for each of n output slots:
   a. Draw `e ~ Exp(1)` (Ziggurat).
   b. Stash `e.to_bits()` into out[i] (treating the u32 slot as f32 bits).
   c. Kahan-add e to running G.
3. Draw e_extra ~ Exp(1); Kahan-add to G (don't store).
4. Compute inv_g = 1/G.
5. Phase 2: walk out left-to-right:
   a. e = f32::from_bits(out[i]); recover the stashed Exp draw.
   b. Kahan-add e to cumulative_e (= S_i).
   c. u = cumulative_e * inv_g; target = (total * u).min(total).
   d. While target > cumulative_w:
        j += 1; Kahan-add weights[j] to cumulative_w.
   e. Write out[i] = j as u32.
```

Note that this routine does *not* call `first_uniform` or use
`SortedUniforms` — the Gamma-ratio identity gives sorted uniforms
directly without `powf`.

The `target.min(total)` clip handles the rare f32 case where
`u_n = S_n / G` rounds up to exactly 1.0 (in f32 this happens when
`E_{n+1}/G < 2⁻²⁵`, with probability ~3% at `n = 10⁶`). Without the
clip, `target` could exceed `cumulative_w` at the right endpoint
even though `u < 1` in exact arithmetic; with it, the merge loop is
guaranteed to terminate within `weights.len()`.

### 4.5. In-place scratch via `f32::to_bits` round-trip

The buffered variant needs `n` Exp(1) draws temporarily before it
walks them again to compute indices. Rather than asking the caller
for a `&mut [f32]` scratch buffer, it stashes each draw's bit
pattern in the output slot it'll later overwrite with the index:

```rust
// Phase 1 store:
*slot = e.to_bits();          // u32, exact bit representation of e

// Phase 2 load:
let e = f32::from_bits(*slot);
// ... compute index j ...
*slot = j as u32;
```

`to_bits` / `from_bits` round-trips are exact for every f32 value
(including NaN and ±∞). Because `out` slots are exactly 32 bits
(`u32`, not `usize`), the layout is platform-independent.

### 4.6. Kahan compensated summation

Every multi-term accumulator on the data path uses Kahan summation:

```rust
fn kahan_add(sum: &mut f32, c: &mut f32, x: f32) {
    let y = x - *c;
    let t = *sum + y;
    *c = (t - *sum) - y;
    *sum = t;
}
```

Naive f32 prefix sums over n non-negative terms accrue relative
error of order `O(n · 2⁻²⁴)`, which becomes unusable around
n ≈ 10⁵. Kahan reduces the bound to `O(2⁻²⁴ · max|term|)` —
effectively constant in `n`.

Accumulators using Kahan:
- `total = Σ weights` and the merge's incremental `cumulative_w`
  in both `sample_indices` and `sample_indices_buffered`.
- `G = Σ Eᵢ` and the merge's `cumulative_e = Sᵢ` in
  `sample_indices_buffered`.

The bit-for-bit identity used in Lemma 3 depends on both the
up-front `total` walk and the merge's `cumulative_w` walk using the
same algorithm and traversal order. Both Kahan-sum `weights` in
increasing index order from `(sum, c) = (0, 0)`. Any change here —
parallel reduce, different traversal, switching to a non-Kahan
accumulator — would invalidate Lemma 3.

### 4.7. Precondition checks in release builds

All four preconditions (§2.3) are checked with `assert!` in
release, not `debug_assert!`:

1. `weights` nonempty — O(1).
2. `weights.len() ≤ u32::MAX` — O(1).
3. Each `weights[i]` finite and nonnegative — O(m), one extra
   branch per element inside the `total` Kahan loop.
4. `Σ weights > 0` — O(1) (a single comparison after the sum).

Items 1, 2, 4 are clearly free. The interesting one is item 3:
its cost is amortized into a loop that already does a Kahan add
(four f32 ops per element). Microbenchmark on the host (m = n =
10⁶, weights `1..=m`) shows the full pipeline shifting from
15.0 ns/step to 15.3 ns/step (streaming) and 11.2 → 11.4 ns/step
(buffered) — about 2% slowdown each, well under the 5% bar we
set when deciding whether to keep this check release-on. We
keep it on because the cost of *not* checking — silent garbage
output from a stray NaN, or an out-of-bounds index from a
negative weight that smuggles `cumulative_w` past `total` —
is much worse than a couple of cycles per element on the cold
prefix-sum loop.

The merge loop itself does no such checks: it operates on
`weights[j]` after we've already validated the slice once.

## 5. Validation & verification

(This is Claude output, currently unchecked by a human
statistician. Corrections welcome.)

### 5.1. Mathematical correctness

#### Lemma 1 (memorylessness of uniform order statistics)

Let `U₁, ..., Uₙ` be iid Uniform(0, 1) and let
`U₍₁₎ ≤ ... ≤ U₍ₙ₎` be their order statistics. For any
1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, conditional on `U₍ᵢ₎ = u`, the remaining order
statistics `U₍ᵢ₊₁₎, ..., U₍ₙ₎` are jointly distributed as the order
statistics of n − i iid Uniform(u, 1) variates.

*Proof.* Standard property of order statistics from a continuous
distribution; see Devroye (1986), §V.3, or David & Nagaraja (2003),
§2.4. The key fact: conditional on `U₍ᵢ₎ = u`, the values `Uⱼ`
exceeding `u` are iid Uniform(u, 1). ∎

#### Lemma 2 (minimum of k uniforms)

If `V₁, ..., Vₖ` are iid Uniform(0, 1) then `min(V₁, ..., Vₖ)` has
CDF `F(v) = 1 − (1 − v)ᵏ` on `[0, 1]` — i.e.
`min(V₁, ..., Vₖ) ~ Beta(1, k)`.

*Proof.* `Pr[min Vᵢ > v] = Πᵢ Pr[Vᵢ > v] = (1 − v)ᵏ`. ∎

#### Theorem 1 (correctness of `SortedUniforms`)

The iterator `SortedUniforms::new(rng, n)` yields a sequence of
values distributed as the order statistics of n iid Uniform(0, 1)
variates.

*Proof.* By induction on `i ∈ {1, ..., n}`. Write `lastᵢ` for the
internal `last` after the i-th yield, with `last₀ = 0`.

*Base case (i = 1).* `remaining = n`, `last = 0`. Compute
`spacing = first_uniform(rng, n)`, distributed as Beta(1, n) by
construction; by Lemma 2 this is the distribution of the minimum
of n iid Uniform(0, 1) — i.e. of `U₍₁₎`. Yield is
`0 + 1 · spacing = spacing`, so `last₁ ~ U₍₁₎`. ✓

*Inductive step.* Assume `(last₁, ..., lastᵢ)` has the joint
distribution of `(U₍₁₎, ..., U₍ᵢ₎)`. Now `remaining = n − i`,
`spacing = first_uniform(rng, n − i) ~ Beta(1, n − i)`. By Lemma 1,
conditional on `lastᵢ = u`, `U₍ᵢ₊₁₎` is the minimum of n − i iid
Uniform(u, 1) draws, equal in distribution to
`u + (1 − u) · min(W₁, ..., Wₙ₋ᵢ)` for `Wⱼ` iid Uniform(0, 1). By
Lemma 2 the inner min is Beta(1, n − i), exactly the distribution
of `spacing`. So `lastᵢ₊₁ = lastᵢ + (1 − lastᵢ) · spacing` has the
correct conditional distribution given `lastᵢ`, extending the
hypothesis to step i + 1. ∎

#### Theorem 2 (correctness of `sample_indices`)

Let `w₁, ..., wₘ ≥ 0` with `T = Σⱼ wⱼ > 0`. Define iid multinomial
draws `K₁, ..., Kₙ` with `Pr[Kₐ = j] = wⱼ / T`. Then the output
sequence `J₁ ≤ ... ≤ Jₙ` produced by
`sample_indices(rng, weights, out)` (with `out.len() = n`) has
the same joint distribution as the sorted multinomial sample
`(K₍₁₎, ..., K₍ₙ₎)`. (1-indexed in this proof; the code is
0-indexed.)

*Proof.* Let `Wⱼ = w₁ + ... + wⱼ`, `F(j) = Wⱼ / T`. The inverse-CDF
multinomial sampler draws `Uₐ ~ Uniform(0, 1)` and sets

```
Kₐ = min { j : F(j) > Uₐ } = min { j : T · Uₐ < Wⱼ }.       (∗)
```

This is correct because `F(j − 1) ≤ Uₐ < F(j)` happens with
probability `wⱼ / T`. The map `Uₐ ↦ Kₐ` is monotone non-decreasing,
so sorting the `Uₐ` and applying (∗) yields the sorted multinomial
sample:

```
(K₍₁₎, ..., K₍ₙ₎) = (φ(U₍₁₎), ..., φ(U₍ₙ₎))                  (∗∗)
```

where `φ(u) = min { j : T · u < Wⱼ }`. By Theorem 1, `sample_indices`
yields `(U₍₁₎, ..., U₍ₙ₎)` distributed as the order statistics of n
iid Uniform(0, 1). For each yielded `U₍ᵢ₎`, the merge sets
`target = T · U₍ᵢ₎` and advances `j` until `target ≤ cumulative = Wⱼ`,
giving

```
Jᵢ = min { j : Wⱼ ≥ T · U₍ᵢ₎ }.                              (∗∗∗)
```

Predicates (∗) and (∗∗∗) differ only on the event `T · U = Wⱼ`,
a measure-zero event under the continuous uniform distribution. So
`Jᵢ = φ(U₍ᵢ₎)` almost surely, matching (∗∗). ∎

### 5.2. Lemma 3 (floating-point boundary)

Suppose `weights[i]` are finite and non-negative with positive sum.
Then `sample_indices` cannot index past `weights.len() − 1`
regardless of values yielded by `SortedUniforms`, provided those
values lie in `[0, 1]`.

*Proof.* `total` is computed by Kahan compensated summation walking
`weights` in index order from `(sum, c) = (0, 0)`:

```
(total, total_c) = (0, 0)
for w in weights:
    (total, total_c) = kahan_add(total, total_c, w)
```

When `j` reaches `m − 1` in the merge, `(cumulative, cumulative_c)`
has been built by initializing `(weights[0], 0)` (equivalent to one
Kahan step from `(0, 0)`, since the first compensator update is
zero) then `kahan_add(cumulative, cumulative_c, weights[k])` for
`k = 1, ..., m − 1` — same weights, same order, same accumulator
algorithm. IEEE 754 addition is deterministic in operands and
rounding mode (round-to-nearest, default in Rust), so Kahan
summation is also deterministic. The two sequences yield bit-
identical results: `cumulative == total` exactly when `j = m − 1`.

Each value `u` yielded by `SortedUniforms` satisfies `u ≤ 1`. Since
`total` is f32-representable and `u ∈ [0, 1]`, the exact product
`total · u ≤ total`; in round-to-nearest f32 this rounds to a
representable value `≤ total` (because `total` itself is
representable, every value `< total` rounds to a representable
value `≤ total`). So `target ≤ total = cumulative` whenever
`j = m − 1`, and the strict inequality `target > cumulative` is
false: the while loop exits with `j = m − 1` rather than
incrementing further. ∎

The buffered variant additionally applies a `target.min(total)`
clip in its merge. This handles the rare f32 case where
`u_n = S_n / G` rounds up to exactly 1.0 (the underlying inputs
satisfy `S_n < G` strictly, but f32 rounding can lose the strict
inequality). Without the clip, `target` could nominally exceed
`total = cumulative_w` at the right endpoint; with it, the merge
terminates within `weights.len()` regardless.

### 5.3. f32 quantization edge case

`first_uniform` returns values strictly in `[0, 1)` by
construction (§4.1). Each of the 2²⁴ input bins from
`rng.gen::<f32>()` maps to a distinct output. For very large `k`
and `u` near 0, `(1 − u)^(1/k)` can round to exactly 1 in f32,
making the output 0 and `spacing = 0`. The recurrence then yields
the prior `last` again — a vanishing statistical artifact (the
f32 quantization of "consecutive order statistics rounded to the
same value"), not a Lemma 3 violation since `last ≤ 1` is
preserved.

### 5.4. Statistical test methodology

(These statistical tests were generated by Claude, and have
not been validated by any human mathematician. Corrections
welcome.)

The integration tests in `tests/statistical.rs` (run via
`cargo test`) check the following invariants. All RNG seeds are
fixed; thresholds are calibrated to keep the **aggregate
random-failure probability under correct code below 1e-9** (the
ten tests share an aggregate budget of `1e-9`, so each test
reserves `~1e-10` and each sub-check inside a test reserves
`~1e-11` after Bonferroni correction over its sub-checks).

1. **Range check** (`range`, deterministic): every `first_uniform`
   sample lies in `[0, 1)` across `k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 100, 1000}`,
   100k samples each.
2. **Empirical moments** (`moments_first_uniform`): mean and
   variance of `first_uniform(k)` match the closed-form Beta(1, k)
   values across `k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 50, 200}`, 1M samples each.
   Mean tolerance 7σ; variance tolerance 2% relative (≈ 14σ at
   1M samples).
3. **One-sample KS** (`ks_against_theory`): empirical CDF of
   `first_uniform` samples vs. analytic `Fₖ(x) = 1 − (1 − x)ᵏ`,
   50k samples each. Critical-value coefficient `c = 3.7`
   (≈ `2·exp(−2c²) ≈ 2.5e-12` per sub-check).
4. **Two-sample KS** (`ks_against_min_oracle`): `first_uniform`
   vs. an independent min-of-k-uniforms oracle (literally
   `min(rng.gen::<f32>(), ...)` over `k` draws), 20k samples each,
   `c = 3.7`.
5. **Sorted-uniforms per-position moments** (`sorted_uniforms_moments`):
   empirical mean and variance at each position match the closed-form
   order-statistic values, 200k runs. Per-position mean tolerance
   `7.5σ` (covers `n` up to 100 positions per test).
6. **Pooled sorted-uniforms KS** (`sorted_uniforms_pooled_ks`):
   pooled output vs. uniform CDF, `c = 3.7`.
7. **Sampler marginal χ²** (`sample_marginals_streaming` and
   `sample_marginals_buffered`): per-index frequency under each
   sampler matches the weight-proportional probabilities, four
   weight cases (uniform, decreasing, peaky, with-zeros).
   Wilson–Hilferty z = 7.0.
8. **Sampler vs. naive multinomial χ²**
   (`sample_vs_multinomial_streaming` and
   `sample_vs_multinomial_buffered`): two-sample chi-squared on
   index-count vectors comparing each sampler against an
   O(m + n log m) inverse-CDF naive multinomial reference (run in
   f64 internally so the reference has no prefix-sum noise of its
   own). Wilson–Hilferty z = 7.0.

The 1e-9 budget is per-fixed-`rand`-version and with fixed
variate usage by the code. If `rand` bumps the algorithm of
any of its samplers, or if the code usage of `rand` changes,
the seeds will produce different sequences and the tests
will need to be re-run. `Cargo.lock` is committed precisely
to pin the `rand` version against this risk in CI /
development.

### 5.5. Microbenchmark methodology

Per-call measurements wrap each call in `std::hint::black_box` to
defeat cross-iteration LLVM autovectorization. A naive loop on x86
with a SIMD libm would let LLVM emit a vectorized `powf` over runs
of consecutive iterations — measuring batched throughput rather
than scalar per-call cost. On Cortex-M4F (and any other no-SIMD
target) batched throughput is unattainable, so scalar per-call
cost is the relevant number. The fences pin the measurement to
that.

Note that *internal* libm SIMD use (using SIMD instructions
to compute one scalar `powf` more quickly) is unaffected by
`black_box`. The 9 ns/call we measure on x86 is the genuine
cost of one scalar `f32::powf` on the host's libm.

---

## 6. Performance

### 6.1. `first_uniform` per-call cost (host x86, `black_box`-fenced)

| k | ns/sample |
|----|----|
| 2  | 9.9 |
| 5  | 10.1 |
| 10 | 10.0 |
| 50 | 10.1 |
| 200 | 9.9 |
| 1000 | 10.0 |

Essentially flat in `k`. Dominated by the scalar `f32::powf` call;
the RNG (Xoshiro256++ in `SmallRng`) is sub-nanosecond per draw and
contributes ~1 ns at most.

### 6.2. Full sampling pipeline

`m = n`, weights `1..=m`, `f32`, all calls `black_box`-fenced,
SmallRng (Xoshiro256++) seed-based. Run-to-run variance is ~3% on
each cell.

Linear scaling clean across five orders of magnitude. Per-step
cost dominated by the `Beta(1, k)` draw (streaming) or the
`Exp(1)` draw plus merge (buffered); cache effects don't
materially degrade large-`m` performance because the weight array
is touched in a single forward sweep.

### 6.3. Cortex-M4F expectations

On Cortex-M4F (no SIMD, scalar `powf` ~100–150 cycles, `Exp(1)`
Ziggurat ~30–60 cycles), the buffered variant is expected to win
by a larger margin than the ~1.32× we see on x86. We have no on-
target measurements yet.

## 7. Future directions

### 7.1. Padé[m/m] rational squeeze for `first_uniform`

The library currently spends one `powf` per `first_uniform` call.
On Cortex-M4F that's expensive. An earlier exploration around a
polynomial squeeze was buggy (it ignored the Mₖ normalization in a
rejection-sampler formulation that was being tried at the time and
produced biased samples — empirical mean for k=2 came out 0.675 vs
theoretical 0.667). The original ICASSP 2008 paper's Ziggurat had a
similar normalization issue (envelope geometry mismatched across
n). Neither is retained.

A more promising not-yet-implemented direction is a Padé[m/m]
rational squeeze in a rejection scheme. The Padé[1/1] form of
`(1 − u)^(1/k)` reduces strikingly cleanly:

```
(1 − u)^(1/k)  ≈  (2k − (k+1)u) / (2k − (k−1)u)
```

so the spacing approximates `u / (k − (k−1)u/2)` (one mult, one
subtract, one divide; no transcendentals). Used directly as a
sampler this is biased — error grows large near `u → 1`, the rare-
but-real "large spacing" tail — and the bias compounds in
`SortedUniforms` over `n = 10⁶` samples. Used as a one-sided
*squeeze* in a rejection scheme with `powf` on the slow path, the
cost amortizes: most attempts decide via the cheap rational test,
and the rare `powf` evaluation is statistically negligible at
moderate-to-large `k`.

On host x86, this is unlikely to beat scalar `powf` (a tuned
libm at ~9 ns/call is hard to beat). On Cortex-M4F, where scalar
`powf` is ~100–150 cycles, an all-mults-and-adds fast path could
plausibly win 30–50%. Whether that's worth the complexity
(correctness proof for one-sidedness, careful slow-path semantics)
depends on the deployment target.
